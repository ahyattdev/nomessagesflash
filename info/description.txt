This tweak disables the camera from flashing when you are using the quick camera in Messages. The quick camera is accessed by holding down the picture button above the keyboard in Messages. It is was a very convenient feature for Apple to add, but they never added an option to disable the automatic flash when using it. This tweak was created to solve that problem. It does not affect the operation of the normal camera in messages.
